My digital paintings are a representation of the otherworldly bond between humans and animals. Each piece is driven by my strong belief that “​until one has loved an ​animal​, a part of one’s soul remains unawakened”- Anatole France. The paintings depict ​one of the most purest forms of friendship–the bond between a child and an animal. 

Through a realistic painting style, I represent the innocence of the child and the tenderness within an animal’s soul. ​In addition, I ​purposefully work with a subdued color palette to encourage a sense of calmness among the viewers and to not distract them from the point of the piece which is the personal interaction among the subjects.

It is necessary to evoke a sense of the love Anatole France mentions in his quote–the kind of love that awakens souls​. I use the facial expressions of the subjects as vessels to convey this love. ​The paintings also emphasize equality among human and animal for we can learn a great deal from them and vice versa.

Through my art, my mission is to pay tribute to the animals who have provided us with their friendship. They undoubtedly give our lives more meaning.
