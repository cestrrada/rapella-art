  In my recent body of work, I capture the essence of people and animals through photo-realistic portrait paintings and illustrations. Through the use of acrylics and digital illustrations, I portray the subjects with a sharp attention to detail and textures. Portrait painting is not only about depicting physical likeness, but connecting with the subject on an intimate level. With my portraits, I invite the viewer to connect with the subject - letting their own ideologies amend the narrative.

  I specifically enjoy painting animals and children together because I believe they have an otherworldly bond. With this connection, I represent the innocence of the child and the tenderness within an animal’s soul. In addition, I ​purposefully work with a subdued color palette to encourage a sense of calmness among the viewers. This color palette is selected to avoid distraction from the personal interaction among the subjects within the work itself. Themes of animal equality, symbiotic friendship, and empowerment are threaded throughout my work.
