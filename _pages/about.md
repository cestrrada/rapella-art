artist_statement: "<p>In my recent body of work, I capture the essence of people and
  animals through photo-realistic portraiture and illustrations. Through the use of
  traditional and digital media, I portray the subjects with a sharp attention to
  detail and textures. Portrait painting is not only about depicting physical likeness,
  but connecting with the subject on an intimate level. With my portraits, I invite
  the viewer to connect with the subject - letting their own ideologies amend the
  narrative.</p> \n\n<p>I specifically enjoy painting animals and children together
  because I believe they have an otherworldly bond. With this connection, I represent
  the innocence of the child and the tenderness within an animal’s soul. In addition,
  I ​purposefully work with a subdued color palette to encourage a sense of calmness
  among the viewers. This color palette is selected to avoid distraction from the
  personal interaction among the subjects within the work itself. Themes of animal
  equality, symbiotic friendship, and empowerment are threaded throughout my work.</p>"
