Madi Rapella focuses on conveying the stories of people and animals through a realistic portraiture style. She mainly works in digital and acrylic mediums. Madi is currently pursuing a bachelor’s degree in visual and public art at California State University, Monterey Bay.

Her work has been shown in several fundraisers such as the St. Baldrick’s childhood cancer charity, Arts for the Cause, and the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society auction. For her last year in highschool, Madi became the founder of Madi’s Respite Service, an after-school arts program designed for special needs children.

In college, she made original cartoons for the student-run newspaper, The Lutrinae from 2017 to 2019. Meanwhile, she produced several illustrations for Cambridge University Press’s book of Aztec Weaponry. For the summer of 2019, Madi was an art education intern at the Kimball Art Center as well as an art instructor at Paint Mixer in Park City, Utah.

She is currently working on her year-long senior capstone _Heroes of Humanity._
